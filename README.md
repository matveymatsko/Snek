# Snek
Using a design pattern other known as MVC (Model, View, Controller), I made a game called "Snek" that is directly inspired by the hit game "Snake". I used SFML 2.5.1, (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) a cross-platform C++ library, for interface for graphics and window management. 

The user must download SFML 2.5.1 in order to interact with the game. More information on how to install it can be found here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/
